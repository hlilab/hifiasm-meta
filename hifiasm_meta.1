.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Hifiasm is an ultrafast haplotype-resolved de novo assembler for PacBio
Hifi reads. Unlike most existing assemblers, hifiasm starts from uncollapsed
genome. Thus, it is able to keep the haplotype information as much as possible.
The input of hifiasm is the PacBio Hifi reads in fasta/fastq format, and its
outputs consist of multiple types of assembly graph in GFA format.

Hifiasm_meta is a fork of hifiasm. It comes with a read selection module, which
enables the assembly of dataset of high redundancy without compromising overall
assembly quality, and meta-centric graphcleaning modules. Currently hifiasm_meta 
does not take bining info.

.SH SPECIAL NOTES
.PP
Based on the limited available test data, real datasets are unlikely to require 
read selection; mock datasets, however, might need it.

Bin file is one-way compatible with the stable hifiasm for now: stable hifiasm can 
use hifiasm_meta's bin file, but not vice versa. hifiasm_meta needs to store extra info from 
overlap & error correction step. This may or may not change in the future.

.SH OPTIONS

.SS General options

.TP 10
.BI -o \ FILE
Prefix of output files [hifiasm_meta.asm]. For detailed description of all assembly
graphs, please see the
.B OUTPUTS
section of this man-page. 

.TP
.BI -B
Use bin files under a different prefix than the one specified by -o.

.TP 10
.BI -t \ INT
Number of CPU threads used by hifiasm_meta [1]. 

.TP
.BI -h
Show help information.

.TP
.BI --version
Show version number. 


.SS Read selection options

.TP 10
.BI -S
Enable read selection. 
If enabled, hifiasm_meta will estimate the total number of read overlaps.
If the estimation seems within acceptable, no read will be dropped; otherwise,
reads will be dropped from the most redundant ones until the criteria
are satisfied.

.TP
.BI --force-preovec
Force read selection. Read will be dropped according to the runtime kmer
frequency threshold described below.

.TP
.BI --lowq-10 \ INT
Runtime 10% quantile kmer frequency threshold used for read selection [50].
Lower value means less reads kept (if read selection is triggered).

.TP
.BI --lowq-5 \ INT
Runtime 5% quantile kmer frequency threshold used for read selection [50].
Lower value means less reads kept (if read selection is triggered).

.TP
.BI --lowq-3 \ INT
Runtime 3% quantile kmer frequency threshold used for read selection [-1, disabled].
Lower value means less reads kept (if read selection is triggered).



.SS Error correction options

.TP 10
.BI -k \ INT
K-mer length [51]. This option must be less than 64.

.TP
.BI -w \ INT
Minimizer window size [51].

.TP
.BI -f \ INT
Number of bits for bloom filter; 0 to disable [37]. This bloom filter is used
to filter out singleton k-mers when counting all k-mers. It takes
.RI 2^( INT -3)
bytes of memory. A proper setting saves memory. 37 is recommended for human
assembly.

.TP
.BI -r \ INT
Rounds of haplotype-aware error corrections [3]. This option affects all outputs of hifiasm_meta.

.TP
.BI --min-hist-cnt \ INT
When analyzing the k-mer spectrum, ignore counts below
.IR INT .

.SS Assembly options

.TP
.BI -a \ INT
Rounds of assembly graph cleaning [4]. This option is used with
.B -x
and
.BR -y .
Note that unlike
.BR -r ,
this option does not affect error corrected reads and all-to-all overlaps.

.TP
.BI -z \ INT
Length of adapters that should be removed [0]. This option remove
.I INT
bases from both ends of each read.
Some old Hifi reads may consist of
short adapters (e.g., 20bp adapter at one end). For such data, trimming short adapters would 
significantly improve the assembly quality.

.TP
.BI -x \ FLOAT, -y \ FLOAT
Max and min overlap drop ratio [0.8, 0.2]. This option is used with
.BR -r .
Given a node
.I N
in the assembly graph, let max(N)
be the length of the largest overlap of
.I N.
Hifiasm_meta iteratively drops overlaps of
.I N
if their length / max(N)
are below a threshold controlled by
.B -x
and
.BR -y .
Hifiasm_meta applies
.B -r
rounds of short overlap removal with an increasing threshold between
.B -x
and
.BR -y .

.TP
.BI -i
Ignore error corrected reads and overlaps saved in
.IR prefix .*.bin
files.
Apart from assembly graphs, hifiasm_meta also outputs three binary files
that save all overlap information during assembly step.
With these files, hifiasm_meta can avoid the time-consuming all-to-all overlap calculation step,
and do the assembly directly and quickly.
This might be helpful when users want to get an optimized assembly by multiple rounds of experiments
with different parameters.

Note that hifiasm_meta's bin files are one-way compatible with hifiasm:
hifiasm can use bins generated by hifiasm_meta, but not vice versa. 


.SS Debugging options

.TP 10
.B --dbg-gfa
Write additional files to speed up the debugging of graph cleaning.

.TP
.BI --ban-meta
Use hifiasm's routines. Note that this switch disables all hifiasm_meta's 
settings, i.e. can't use the meta read selection with regular hifiasm graph 
cleaning. This may change in the future.



.TP
.BI --dump-all-ovlp
Hifiasm(_meta) only keeps a limited number of overlap targets for a read (specified by -N).
Overlaps discarded here will not show up in the --write-paf dump. 
They are irrelevant in most use cases, but if the user is interested, 
this switch can write all overlaps ever calculated in the final round of overlapping calculation
to a paf file named
.IR prefix .all_ovlp_pairs 
(paf format).


.SH OUTPUTS

.PP
Hifiasm_meta generates the following assembly graphs in the GFA format:

.RS 2
.TP 2
*
.IR prefix .r_utg.gfa:
the raw unitig graph. This graph keeps all haplotype information.

.TP
*
.IR prefix .p_utg.gfa:
processed unitig graph without small bubbles and tips. 

.TP
*
.IR prefix .p_ctg.gfa:
assembly graph of primary contigs. This graph collapses different haplotypes.

.TP
*
.IR prefix .a_ctg.gfa:
assembly graph of alternate contigs. This graph consists of all assemblies that
are discarded in primary contig graph.

.RE

.PP
For each graph, hifiasm(_meta) also outputs a simplified version without sequences for
the ease of visualization ("noseq" in the file names). 
Hifiasm(_meta) keeps corrected reads and overlaps in three
binary files such as it can regenerate assembly graphs from the binary files
without redoing error correction.

Hifiasm_meta's contig graphs contain the following subgraph information:

1) Contig names are `^s[0-9]+\.[uc]tg[0-9]{6}[lc]` where the `s[0-9]+` is 
a disconnected subgraph label of the contig. 
It might be useful to be able to quickly checking whether two contigs are 
in the same disconnected subgraph (i.e. haplotype that wasn't assembled 
in to a single contig, tangled haplotypes).

2) A trail of subgraph labels is stored in a custom gfa tag 
ts:B:I (uint32_t array, comma seperated). This can be used to quickly check 
if two unconnected contigs or subgraphs were once connected during graph cleaning,
since for metagenome assemblies, the alterantive graph and unitigs are more ambiguous
the assembly of a single organism. The representation, for example, 
say we have 3 graphs, A, B and C. A is splitted into two graphs, A1 and A2; 
A2 is further splicted into A2a, A2b and A2c. 
Then A1 may be labelled as 0.0, A2a as 0.1.0, A2b as 0.1.1, A2c as 0.1.2, 
B as 1, and C as 2 (integers are arbitrary but unique).
